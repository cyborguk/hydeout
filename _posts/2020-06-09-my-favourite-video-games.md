This is not an list of the "best", most popular and most technically brilliant
games ever, although many of them are. This is a list of games I have enjoyed
playing the most, and provided the most satisfying return on my time. Reducing
the substantial list of games that come to mind down to only a handful was
difficult, given that technology has changed so much in forty years, as has the
amount of free time I have to play games nowadays. No more summer holidays to
play endlessly, but on the other hand we can at least save our progress now.

### Chuckie Egg (Acorn Electron/BBC Micro, 1983)
Collect all the eggs on each level while avoiding the storks. A great
platformer with nice clear graphics, and good speed while the
near-indestructable character Hen-Hunter Harry flies around the screen. The
game, which has echoes of Donkey Kong (but in my opinion, more enjoyable), was
originally designed by a 16-year old boy for the ZX Spectrum, and made it onto
many other platforms. The Spectrum version should be avoided due to unrealistic
physics and awful colour bleed and collision detection. The 8-bit Acorn version
was excellent, apart from the annoying character flicker. It's still very playable
today.

### Repton series (Acorn, 1985+)
Another game created by a schoolkid, Repton was a rocks-and-diamonds puzzle
game which had my whole family involved at one point on a particular puzzle.
The game was slower paced, and more cerebral than Boulderdash, which was
available on the rival Commodore 64.
Further sequels came and expanded the game with some excellent features. I
bought and enjoyed them thoroughly.

### Bubble Bobble (Arcade, 1986)
The pure playability, combined with a cooperative, rather than combative
approach make this an uplifting game to enjoy with a partner as you trap
enemies in bubbles and pop them into oblivion.
I still play this 35-year-old game regularly. Fortunately, MAME's ability to
save game states makes it easy to just jump in where you and your companion
left off previously.

### Exile (Acorn Electron/BBC Micro, 1988)
Exile was a technically brilliant and pioneering game which involved
exploration of a vast subterranean network of tunnels and caverns on a planet you
have crash landed on. Tough puzzles (it's a while before you even manage to
obtain a gun), often involving the game's clever physics model, and more
"intelligent" characters than many other games of its time made
this an enjoyable game with decent longevity. Despite hours of play, I never
managed to complete it. A common issue with these type of games in the
pre-internet era, you relied on the games pages of magazines to provide
walkthroughs and maps...I probably drew my own map at some point.

### Elite (Acorn Electron, Archimedes)
The original space-trading game, Elite was released when I was at primary
school. The wireframe graphics and procedurally-generated planets set this game
far above anything that had been since on 8-bit home computers before. The
32-bit power of the Archimedes allowed solid 3D colour ships and an expanded
scope, producing the best version of the original game. In addition to sequels
in the Elite series, a Free Open Source remake called *Oolite* was made, and
greatly enhanced many areas of the original game, providing all the expansions
that a player could wish for, including mythical Generation Ships, which never
existed in the original, despite teasers in the game literature.

### Sim City 3000 (PC,1999)
Like Doom, most people who used a computing device in the 20 years after this
game's original release have probably played it at some point, be it console,
PC or Palm Pilot. By the time Sim City 3000 was released in 1999, screen
resolution and computer capabilities had improved, and the game was a lot more
fun. Still a lot of micro-management to do, but with a lack of discipline, one
could lose days and weeks at a time to this time sink. 

### Skyrim (Xbox 360, 2011)
After a busy few years with young children and no time to play games, I bought
a pre-owned Xbox 360 for a pittance a few years ago, and also picked up a
second-hand Skyrim for next-to-nothing as the epic dragon-slaying free-world
adventure game was now a good few years old. One
of my most enjoyable gaming experiences of recent years, and certainly one
that I have spent most time playing in that period. The game features
fantastic atmospherics and scope for exploration in a beautiful landscape.
After a while, my Xbox suffered a hardware failure, so I had to find another
one to complete this game. The PC version is considered best, not least due to
the opportunity for modifications.

### Tomb Raider (Playstation, 1996)
At the time of release of this slower-paced action-adventure puzzle game, the
graphics and scope of the game were very impressive.
Subsequent technological advances can make playing this game now rather
jarring, due to polygon overload and sometimes awkward controls,
but it was a game-changer at the time. I got this game bundled with the
Playstation at purchase, and played it to completion. Great memories. 

### Super Mario Kart/Mario Kart Wii (SNES,1992; Wii,2008)
Super Mario Kart on the SNES was great in its day. I spent a large part of my
undergraduate degree playing this and Sensible Soccer with my housemates. I
even got pretty good at shaving fractions of a second off time trial scores
with technical precision. Playing the game today is fun, but of limited appeal
given that there are newer incarnations available. In particular, Mario Kart
Wii is notable due to the different driving styles available (including a
detached steering wheel that is the driving equivalent of "air guitar"), but
additionally because of the community-made tracks available via the CGTP mod.
It's a real shame that Nintendo don't make their games and consoles easier to
make custom content for, as it adds a huge amount of enjoyment and longevity to
games.

### Donkey Kong Country Returns (Wii,2010)
Donkey Kong Country Returns is a side-scrolling 2-player platformer, and what a
great one it is. Unlike many of its contemporaries, in a nod to games from a
previous era the difficulty level was dialled up a notch, requiring levels to
be learned and repeated in order to beat them. The game has immense
replayability, due to the puzzle pieces and bonuses hidden on each level.
Playing with a friend requires good communication and understanding, due to the
level of cooperation required but it's worth it.

### Osmos (Android)
This relaxing and atmospheric game makes good use of a touch interface to move
your amoebic blob among a floating mass of other blobs, absorbing smaller ones
in order to grow. Play with headphones and immerse yourself for a while.

### Sensible Soccer (Various platforms, 1992)
This game isn't much to look at, but dismiss it at your peril: while other '90s
football games were beginning their journey to life-like graphics, Sensible
Soccer's top down approach went for playability. By going against the
prevailing trend of other games, they somehow managed to great a game that felt
like real football. It certainly provided good entertainment when when with a
few mates, and the game became a real favourite among football fans. It was
available for various platforms, but I spent most time playing it on the SNES,
Archimedes and Amiga.
